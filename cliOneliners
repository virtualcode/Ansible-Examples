# Collection of ansible cli one liners.
#  Some assumptions may (or may not :-) be applicable:
#         [all] group is defined in /etc/ansible/hosts or elsewhere 
#         ssh public key is configured for root
#         no password required to become root


# localhost is always defined explicitly
ansible localhost -m ping
ansible localhost --ask-pass -m ping

ansible all -m shell -a "uptime"
ansible -i hosts all -m ping
ansible -i hosts all -m setup
ansible all -m setup

# using apt
ansible all -m shell -a  "apt list"
ansible all -b -m shell -a  "apt-get update -y"
ansible all -b -m shell -a  "apt upgrade -y"
ansible all -b -m shell -a  "apt autoremove -y"
ansible v1 -s -m shell -a 'yum list installed | grep python'

ansible -i hosts all --ask-pass -b -m 'apt package=libopenblas-dev state=present'
ansible -i hosts all -b -m 'apt package=libopenblas-dev state=present'
